# Self learning about Artificial Inteligence

The purpose of this repository is to record developments in my personal studies on artificial intelligence. It will feature a division between portfolios in relation to the division of study areas.

Although it may seem like a project, it should not be seen as one. In fact, it should be viewed as a large binder with notes, insights and challenges, containing correct and incorrect practices of the knowledge obtained

# makefile
The makefile creates a docker container according to which project I am currently studying. Therefore, I can have several environments without cluttering my computer with different prerequisites between projects. Facilitating cleaning after studies.

If you use Visual Studio Code, I recommend using the extension "https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh", so it is possible to debug the codes inside the containers.

# Organization

TODO
...

The plots of projects will not be commit and is on .gitignore also. Recommend to create file plot to see the results of code, to don't need to create harders configure, KISS.
